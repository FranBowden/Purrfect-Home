  catDescription: "Henry is a ginger whirlwind of energy and mischief. He\u2019s
    always climbing something he shouldn\u2019t or ambushing your ankles. At four
    years old, he hasn\u2019t outgrown his kitten antics and probably never will.
    He\u2019s healthy, loud, endlessly curious, and definitely thinks he runs the
    shelter."
  catListingDescription: Henry is a lively, mischievous ginger cat full of energy,
    curiosity, and playful antics who loves to be the center of attention.
