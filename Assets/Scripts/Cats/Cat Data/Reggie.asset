  catDescription: "Reggie is a black and white sweetheart with a gentle soul and
    a nervous streak. He suffers from anxiety, especially around loud noises or sudden
    movements, and tends to hide when he\u2019s overwhelmed. But once he feels safe,
    he becomes incredibly affectionate, curling up in laps, purring like a motorbike,
    and nuzzling anyone who shows him a bit of kindness."
