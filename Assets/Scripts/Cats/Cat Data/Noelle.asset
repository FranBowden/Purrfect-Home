  catDescription: "Noelle is a quiet, soft-furred cat who\u2019s shy around strangers
    but blossoms into a cuddlebug once she knows you. She adores curling up next
    to her favourite people and can\u2019t resist playing with anything stringy 
    shoelaces, hoodie cords, you name it. Oddly enough, she absolutely refuses to
    eat wet food, no matter the brand. Biscuits only, thank you very much."
  catListingDescription: Noelle is a shy but loving cat who warms up to trusted people,
    loves cuddles and stringy toys, and prefers dry food only.
