  catDescription: "Clyde was abandoned at just one year old, left behind when his
    previous owners moved out and never came back. He\u2019s still learning to trust
    people again, but behind those wary eyes is a softie who wants a second chance.
    Health-wise, he\u2019s in good condition, though a bit underweight from his time
    on the streets."
  catListingDescription: Clyde is a gentle young cat recovering trust after abandonment,
    healthy but a bit underweight, and ready for a loving second chance.
